Short version - download the zip package from the releases page, extract the "mastergunner-woodcock500" folder, and place that inside MSFS2020's "Community folder" - which can be found at "%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_[RANDOM LETTERS HERE]\LocalCache\Packages\Community".

Launch the game, and "CBQ8 Woodcock Airport" should show up as an airport option in free flight.
